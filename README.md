EDUCATION

MSc. Physics

University of Ottawa - May 2023

Was a Teacher’s Assistant for multiple courses, which included leading discussion sessions and workshops to provide additional support to those who needed it.

Attended and led weekly lab meetings, broadening my team and leadership skills.

Studied statistics, computational and nonlinear dynamics where I gained tools for handling chaotic systems, large sets of data, and deep learning networks.

Developed a computational network of neurons to investigate seizure-prone networks, with code available at: https://github.com/PAFoley/MSCThesis

While it was previously known that increasing cellular heterogeneity increases the neuronal firing rate, determined that entrainment must be broken before this occurs.



BSc. Theoretical Physics, with Honours

University of Guelph - June 2019

Gained experience in numerous mathematical, computational, and statistical techniques which fastened my ability to solve related problems.

Published a scientific analysis focused on platypus milk in the local newspaper, which was initially required for a science communication course.

Previously held the Guinness World Record for largest elephant toothpaste as part of outreach with the Physics Club.




WORK EXPERIENCE

Mobile Sales - Best Buy

November 2023 - Current

Obtained tangible experience by assisting customers with a wide array of problems and by answering many different questions.

​​​​​​​
Software Tester - ADGA

August 2019 – September 2020

Procured an understanding of the software development pipeline and the full development cycle by actively assisting other team members outside of testing.

Implemented both manual and automated test cases for various pieces of software which enhanced my understanding of command-and-control concepts.

Worked firsthand with client representatives to ensure the product matched the requirements, and had the quality-of-life features, for those who would use it.
